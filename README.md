This project is a Transformers-themed trivia game made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, and timers.

Directions to play:
- Press 'Start Quiz!' to begin the game.
- You will have 15 seconds to answer each question. Selecting the incorrect answer, or running out of time will increment your 'incorrect' score.
- Answer correctly and you will increment your 'correct' score!
- After you've chosen an answer/time has run out, the correct answer and an image will be displayed.
- Once you have answered all the questions, you will see your score totals and receive an option to play the game again. 

Future iterations of this project will include:
- Responsive images
